				<h3>Brown Science Prep's Mission</h3>
				<p>Our mission is to show high school students the excitement of science through interactive, hands-on lessons. Our program is <b>completely free</b>, provides free breakfast, and is open to all high school students. 

				<h3>What Do We Do?</h3>
				<p>Every Saturday, high school students from all over Rhode Island come to Brown to participate in BSP. We do science experiments and demo-based lessons in an informal environment. Some of our past lessons have included dissecting a fetal pig, learning about the brain, and discovering the science behind candy. We also meet in small groups to talk about what college is like and how to prepare for the application process. At the end of the semester, we bring in Brown scientists to talk to students about their research, career paths, and passion for science.</p>
				<p>Check out <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/11/10/brown-science-prep-takes-students-to-mars/">this</a> article the Brown Daily Herald wrote about us!</p>
				<h3>A Typical Saturday</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left"><b>10:30</b> Students arrive at Brown and eat breakfast while talking to our mentors.</p>
				<p style="text-align:left"><b>11:00</b> Lesson of the week! Students do experiments and participate in demos during the entire lesson.</p>

							<p class="description">Aloha, I'm Shirley Lin, a current senior concentrating in Neuroscience. With my education here, I hope to go to medical school one day. I'm from the island of O'ahu in Hawai'i and my favorite thing to do is drive to the North Shore and eat local food (check out Giovanni's Shrimp Truck and Matsumoto's Shave Ice). My second favorite thing to do is try to get mainlanders to say the name of our state fish, the humuhumunukunukuapua'a. I'm a huge advocate of converting people from saying "flip-flops" to "slippers". My main goal here at Brown is to survive the winter. My spirit animal is a seal or maybe a thumb, but I'm also fond of ostriches, emus, vultures, and various other ugly birds. Mahalo for reading. Shoots.</p>

I’m part of a few research teams at Brown, so if you're curious about what research is like, definitely ask. I'm also a teaching assistant in the computer science department, which means I get to help people dive deep into problems and understand them better. When I'm not doing science, I like spending time outside, whether I’m reading under the big and beautiful trees on campus or just talking and walking around with friends.</p>

I'm from the wonderful state of New Jersey, home of taylor ham (think SPAM but more edible) and highway exits. On campus, I'm involved with the Brown Daily Herald and the Undergraduate Council of Students. When I have free time, I like to play in jam sessions on bass and ukelele, sometimes at the same time, and binge watch Supernatural on Netflix.</p>

I grew up outside of Boston, and when I’m not wondering why I didn’t move somewhere warmer for college, I’m probably conducting research in the (temperature controlled) lab, over-analyzing song lyrics or looking at pictures of cats. Biomedical research stole my heart at the beginning of college, and it also motivates me to work within and outside of Brown to help create accessible platforms that inspire and support scientific curiosity. This is my first semester with BSP, and I’m looking forward to getting to know y’all!  </p>

I’m planning to double concentrate in Public Health and Biology and aspire to work as a physician someday. I think high school is an important time to help students develop a love and enthusiasm for science, which is why I’m so excited to be a BSP mentor! At Brown I’m a Meiklejohn advisor and also a part of Design+Health, which is an awesome collaboration between RISD, Brown, and Alpert Medical School. Outside of school, you’ll find me playing the piano, binge watching anime, but most importantly, cooking. I love anything and everything related to food, cooking, and grocery shopping, so you’ll probably be able to find me at the Farmer’s Market on weekend mornings!</p>

My favorite way to spend time is by hanging out and chatting with friends about everything from food on campus to predicting the future (scientifically, of course). Meanwhile, my favorite way to waste time is by playing too much internet chess and reading the news. Outside of all that, I enjoy playing tennis and piano and wondering how our world really works.

When I am not finishing up a Chem problem set or preparing bacteria in wells, I am usually in the gym, on the tennis court, singing and dancing, or eating.

							<h5 class="description-header">Mentor</h5>
							<p class="description">Hi! I'm Sunil and I'm a second-year from just outside Washington, DC concentrating in Development Studies. In high school I spent a lot of time building robots, so I'm quite a tech-oriented person and an advocate for inclusion in STEM. Last year I took half STEM and half humanities classes, which was really awesome, but I'm pretty humanities-oriented now. Outside of studies, I'm usually listening to Drake, rewatching Game of Thrones, or drinking tea (early grey all the way... The Queen's Drink) or a quality latte. I was really into teaching science in high school, so I'm really excited to continue working with BSP! </p>

							<h5 class="description-header">Mentor</h5>
							<p class="description">Hey! My name is Jack Ciabaton, and I am a first-year at Brown. I am currently planning on concentrating in Mathematics and/or Computer Science, but I love all of science! I am from Naples, Florida, and outside of BSP, I have gotten involved with Taekwondo, Quiz Bowl, and Science Olympiad here at Brown. In my free time, I like to sleep (a lot) and browse Wikipedia, learning about interesting ideas like the Ham Sandwich Theorem and the Boltzmann Brain (look them up!). I would love to do research in science someday, and I can’t wait to meet you!</p>

							<h5 class="description-header">Mentor</h5>
							<p class="description">Hey! My name is Zach and I’m a first year at Brown from just outside of Boston. I’m planning on studying a subset of chemistry or neuroscience and hoping one day to become a doctor! In my free time I love to read fiction (Harry Potter and the Maze Runner are a few of my favorites), watch movies (especially those mind-bending ones like Ocean’s Eleven), and just hang out with friends (it’s never too early or late for a trip for ice cream).</p>

					<h3>DEADLINE AND APPLICATION PROCEDURE</h3>
					<p>Thank you for your interest in Brown Science Prep! You can apply to be a mentor <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVV_zmJAXiYW8LnxX51mDwUMldA0RDSSFmAjhFBoLhC6uLnA/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>. The application deadline is <strong>Thursday, September 13th, 2018 at 11:59 P.M</strong>.</p>
					<p>After reviewing the applications, we will conduct 20 minutes interviews from September 15th-18th. Come to the interview with a 5 minute mini-lesson that you can demo for us. For the mini-lesson, you will be provided with a whiteboard and colored markers. Feel free to bring any additional materials that you think would enhance the learning of your students (e.g., powerpoint, handout). We are looking for lessons that are interactive, well-organized, and accessible to high school students without a background in basic sciences.</p>
					<p>Decisions will be emailed by 5 P.M. on September 29th.</p>
					<h3>POSITION DESCRIPTION</h3>
					<p>We have compiled <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rn-fFbdSEHnjk1hUeHm2pzgAqNbR2bFhilflbf42IXM/edit">this</a> informational packet to demonstrate what makes Brown Science Prep (BSP) unique and to help you determine whether you would like to become a part of our BSP family of mentors.  This packet includes important information about our mission, our goals, and our structure.</p>
					<p>We are looking for Brown students who are equally passionate about science (a science concentration is NOT required) and community outreach.  Accordingly, we envision two distinctive yet interconnected roles.  As teachers, we seek to impart knowledge and problem-solving skills while promoting independent and creative thinking in our students.  As mentors, we seek to foster genuine relationships with our students, enabling them to feel comfortable enough to ask questions, participate actively, and just have a really fun time each Saturday.  We promise you that you will learn as much from our students as they will learn from you.</p> 
					<p>We hope that you will find the following information useful in deciding whether to apply as a mentor!</p>
					</div>-->
					<p>Mentor applications are closed for Fall 2018. Check back in the Spring :)</p>
