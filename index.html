				<div style='text-align:left'>
				<h3>Brown Science Prep's Mission</h3>
				<p>Our mission is to show high school students the excitement of science through lessons geared toward real world phenomena, applicable learning, hands-on demonstrations, and experimentation. The program is structured so that Brown undergraduates teach and mentor several students over the course of the semester, encouraging the formation of strong bonds.</p>
				<h3>What Do We Do?</h3>
				<p>Every Saturday, high school students from all over Rhode Island come to Brown to participate in BSP. We do science experiments and demo-based lessons in an informal environment; some of our past lessons have included dissecting a fetal pig, learning about the brain, and discovering the science behind candy. We also meet in small groups to talk about what college is like and how to prepare for the application process. At the end of the semester, we bring in Brown scientists to talk to students about their research, career paths, and passion for science.</p>
				<p>Check out <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/11/10/brown-science-prep-takes-students-to-mars/">this</a> article the Brown Daily Herald wrote about us!</p>
				<h3>A Typical Saturday</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left"><b>10:30</b> Students arrive at Brown and eat breakfast while talking to our mentors.</p>
				<p style="text-align:left"><b>11:00</b> Lesson of the week! Students do experiments and participate in demos during the entire lesson.</p>

							<h5 class="description-header">Coordinator</h5>
							<p class="description">Hey y'all! I'm Ryan, and I study neurobiochemistry here at Brown. I love to teach science as well as use science to problem solve in everyday life. When I'm not obsessing over the phrase "life is but an expression of proteins" or thinking about the seven billion billion billion atoms in the human body (and don't get me started on the Universe...), I am usually doing one of three things: drinking all the smoothies the world has to offer, getting totally lost in the mountains of northern New England, or trying to telepathically communicate with my two cats back home. With your help, my goal is to make this year of BSP the best one yet!</p>

							<p class="description">Aloha, I'm Shirley Lin, a current junior concentrating in Biology. With my education here, I hope to go to medical school one day. I'm from the island of O'ahu in Hawai'i and my favorite thing to do is drive to the North Shore and eat local food (check out Giovanni's Shrimp Truck and Matsumoto's Shave Ice). My second favorite thing to do is try to get mainlanders to say the name of our state fish, the humuhumunukunukuapua'a. I'm a huge advocate of converting people from saying "flip-flops" to "slippers". My main goal here at Brown is to survive the winter. My spirit animal is a seal or maybe a thumb, but I'm also fond of ostriches, emus, vultures, and various other ugly birds. Mahalo for reading. Shoots.</p>

Even though my concentration is currently a somewhat un-sciency Comp Sci and Econ, I still love exploring and teaching science through BSP. Outside of being a part of the BSP fam, I'm a chess player, older brother, Taylor Swift fan, and avid Waffle House frequenter. </p>

When I’m not eating, I am part of the Chinese Student Association here at Brown and like to run in my free time. I am also interested in poetry so please tell me your favorite poets if you ever run into me!

I’m from Chicago, Illinois and hope to pursue a career in medicine (my main interest is in neuroscience). Apart from BSP, I’m also a member of Brown’s quizbowl team and an avid reader.

I’m Shoshana, a second-year whose current interests are too all-over-the-place to have a concentration (though if I were you, I’d put my money on Computer Science). I’m from Florida, so pardon my confusion when it’s fifty degrees out and not snowing. When I’m not doing BSP, I’m probably deleting emails—as a first-year, I take pride in being on too many listservs. I’m also really into thought experiments, computational linguistics, music, and political activism, and I’m super excited for this all-over-the-place list to grow throughout my experience with BSP. </p>

I'm from the wonderful state of New Jersey, home of taylor ham (think SPAM but more edible) and highway exits. On campus, I'm involved with the Brown Daily Herald and the Undergraduate Council of Students. When I have free time, I like to play in jam sessions on bass and ukelele, sometimes at the same time, and binge watch Supernatural on Netflix.</p>

I currently live in Connecticut but I was born in England and go back to see family a lot. In my spare time I like to hike, play on the club tennis team, and obsess over English Premier League soccer (I’m a massive Manchester United fan). I also love to read, drink tea, listen to as much music as possible, and run (though not all at the same time). I’m really excited to join the BSP team!</p>

I’m all the way from Hawaii so these New England winters are quite the struggle. I don’t have a concentration yet but I really like proteins, chem labs, and rocks. So I’ll probably end up in something like geology-chemistry or biochemistry. When I’m not in the Sciences Library, you can probably find me hitting some taiko drums or coaching Science Olympiad (I LOVE Science Olympiad).</p>

							<p class="description">Hello! My name is Greg Benitez and I am a second-year here at Brown. Settling in has been fairly easy as I live only 15 minutes away from Brown's campus in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. As of now, I am on the fence of either concentrating in Computational Biology or Biochemistry/Molecular Biology but luckily for me, I have a lot of time to make a decision. While I am not studying, I love to play soccer, ultimate frisbee, play FIFA, and of course, eat food. I am eager to share my passion for science with the rest of you!</p>

I hope to concentrate in Environmental science or Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.  I enjoy long distance runs, chocolate, and pistachios. Also, I enjoy looking at pictures of cute animals on google (search “snow monkeys”).  On a more important note, I am a strong advocate for eliminating raisins in desserts.</p>

Shadowing an open heart surgery was probably the most epic moment of my high school career. Aside from the life sciences, I want to learn more about design and perhaps computer science. Before I graduate, I hope to take a class at RISD. In my spare time, I enjoy watercolor painting, occasional doses of classical music, and a good cup of boba. </p>

Outside of BSP, I’m also involved with the Brown Chess Club and I volunteer at a local clinic in Providence.

					<h3>DEADLINE AND APPLICATION PROCEDURE</h3>
					<p>Thank you for your interest in Brown Science Prep! You can apply to be a mentor <a href="https://form.jotform.com/72328559184162">here</a>. The application deadline is <strong>September 14th at 11:59 P.M</strong>.</p>
					<p>After reviewing the applications, we will conduct 20 minutes interviews from September 16th-19th. Come to the interview with a 5 minute mini-lesson that you can demo for us. For the mini-lesson, you will be provided with a whiteboard and colored markers. Feel free to bring any additional materials that you think would enhance the learning of your students (e.g., powerpoint, handout). We are looking for lessons that are interactive, well-organized, and accessible to high school students without a background in basic sciences.</p>
					<p>Decisions will be emailed by 5 P.M. on September 20th.</p>
					<h3>POSITION DESCRIPTION</h3>
					<p>We have compiled <a href="documents/info_packet.pdf">this</a> informational packet to demonstrate what makes Brown Science Prep (BSP) unique and to help you determine whether you would like to become a part of our BSP family of mentors.  This packet includes important information about our mission, our goals, and our structure.</p>
					<p>We are looking for Brown students who are equally passionate about science (a science concentration is NOT required) and community outreach.  Accordingly, we envision two distinctive yet interconnected roles.  As teachers, we seek to impart knowledge and problem-solving skills while promoting independent and creative thinking in our students.  As mentors, we seek to foster genuine relationships with our students, enabling them to feel comfortable enough to ask questions, participate actively, and just have a really fun time each Saturday.  We promise you that you will learn as much from our students as they will learn from you.</p> 
					<p>We hope that you will find the following information useful in deciding whether to apply as a mentor!</p>
					<p>Fun fact: 100% of our mentors in Spring 2017 "agreed" or "strongly agreed" that BSP had met or exceeded their expectations!</p>
					</div>-->
					<p>Mentor applications are closed for Fall 2017. Check back in the spring :)
