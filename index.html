				<div style='text-align:left'>
				<h3>Brown Science Prep's Mission</h3>
				<p>Our mission is to show high school students the excitement of science through lessons geared toward real world phenomena, applicable learning, hands-on demonstrations, and experimentation. The program is structured so that Brown undergraduates teach and mentor several students over the course of the semester, encouraging the formation of strong bonds.</p>
				<h3>What Do We Do?</h3>
				<p>Every Saturday, high school students from all over Rhode Island come to Brown to participate in BSP. We do science experiments and demo-based lessons in an informal environment; some of our past lessons have included dissecting a fetal pig, learning about the brain, and discovering the science behind candy. We also meet in small groups to talk about what college is like and how to prepare for the application process. At the end of the semester, we bring in Brown scientists to talk to students about their research, career paths, and passion for science.</p>
				<p>Check out <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/11/10/brown-science-prep-takes-students-to-mars/">this</a> article the Brown Daily Herald wrote about us!</p>
				<h3>A Typical Saturday</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left"><b>10:30</b> Students arrive at Brown and eat breakfast while talking to our mentors.</p>
				<p style="text-align:left"><b>11:00</b> Lesson of the week! Students do experiments and participate in demos during the entire lesson.</p>

							<p class="description">Hey y'all! I'm Ryan, and I study neurobiochemistry here at Brown. I love to teach science as well as use science to problem solve in everyday life. When I'm not obsessing over the phrase "life is but an expression of proteins" or thinking about the seven billion billion billion atoms in the human body (and don't get me started on the Universe...), I am usually doing one of three things: drinking all the smoothies the world has to offer, getting totally lost in the mountains of northern New England, or trying to telepathically communicate with my two cats back home. With your help, my goal is to make this year of BSP the best one yet!</p>

							<p class="description">Aloha, I'm Shirley Lin, a current junior concentrating in Neuroscience. With my education here, I hope to go to medical school one day. I'm from the island of O'ahu in Hawai'i and my favorite thing to do is drive to the North Shore and eat local food (check out Giovanni's Shrimp Truck and Matsumoto's Shave Ice). My second favorite thing to do is try to get mainlanders to say the name of our state fish, the humuhumunukunukuapua'a. I'm a huge advocate of converting people from saying "flip-flops" to "slippers". My main goal here at Brown is to survive the winter. My spirit animal is a seal or maybe a thumb, but I'm also fond of ostriches, emus, vultures, and various other ugly birds. Mahalo for reading. Shoots.</p>

Even though my concentration is currently a somewhat un-sciency Comp Sci and Econ, I still love exploring and teaching science through BSP.

I’m from Chicago, Illinois and hope to pursue a career in medicine (my main interest is in neuroscience). Apart from BSP, I’m also a member of Brown’s quizbowl team and an avid reader.

I'm from the wonderful state of New Jersey, home of taylor ham (think SPAM but more edible) and highway exits. On campus, I'm involved with the Brown Daily Herald and the Undergraduate Council of Students. When I have free time, I like to play in jam sessions on bass and ukelele, sometimes at the same time, and binge watch Supernatural on Netflix.</p>

I currently live in Connecticut but I was born in England and go back to see family a lot. In my spare time I like to hike, play on the club tennis team, and obsess over English Premier League soccer (I’m a massive Manchester United fan). I also love to read, drink tea, listen to as much music as possible, and run (though not all at the same time). I’m really excited to join the BSP team!</p>

I’m all the way from Hawaii so these New England winters are quite the struggle. I don’t have a concentration yet but I really like proteins, chem labs, and rocks. So I’ll probably end up in something like geology-chemistry or biochemistry. When I’m not in the Sciences Library, you can probably find me hitting some taiko drums or coaching Science Olympiad (I LOVE Science Olympiad).</p>

								My name is Greg Benitez and I am a sophomore looking to double concentrate in Biology and Public Health! The Bio-side of me is intrigued by Microbiology/Immunology while the Public Health side is interested in Epidemiology. So, learning about infectious diseases and how they impact us - both on an individual and population level - is really worth it! Apart from learning about diseases, I really like soccer so if I'm not playing it, I am watching a game; and if I'm not doing either, I'm probably playing FIFA. </p>

Outside of BSP, I’m also involved with the Brown Chess Club and I volunteer at a local clinic in Providence.

Shadowing an open heart surgery was probably the most epic moment of my high school career. Aside from the life sciences, I want to learn more about design and perhaps computer science. Before I graduate, I hope to take a class at RISD. In my spare time, I enjoy watercolor painting, occasional doses of classical music, and a good cup of boba. </p>

Throughout high school, I was fascinated by the sciences, biology and chemistry particularly. It is an amazing subject that I love to discuss with my fellow science-enthusiasts. When I am not finishing up a Chem problem set or preparing bacteria in wells, I am usually in the gym, on the tennis court, singing and dancing, or eating. I am from the beautiful city of Philadelphia, making me a life-long supporter of cheesteaks, the Eagles, and Lil Uzi Vert. I am looking forward to meeting all of you!</p>

I'm Sunil and I'm a first-year from Maryland interested in concentrating in neuroscience, English, or philosophy—not really sure yet, but I know I want to go to medical school eventually. In high school I spent a lot of time building robots, so I'm quite a tech-oriented person and an advocate for inclusion in STEM. Right now, I'm taking half STEM and half humanities classes, which is really awesome. Outside of studies, I'm usually listening to Drake, rewatching Game of Thrones, or drinking tea (early grey all the way... The Queen's Drink) or a quality latte. I was really into teaching science in high school, so I'm really excited to be working with BSP! </p>

You can apply to be a mentor <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVV_zmJAXiYW8LnxX51mDwUMldA0RDSSFmAjhFBoLhC6uLnA/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>. The application deadline is <strong>Thursday, September 13th, 2018 at 11:59 P.M</strong>.</p>
					<p>After reviewing the applications, we will conduct 20 minutes interviews from September 15th-18th. Come to the interview with a 5 minute mini-lesson that you can demo for us. For the mini-lesson, you will be provided with a whiteboard and colored markers.

We are looking for lessons that are interactive, well-organized, and accessible to high school students without a background in basic sciences.</p>

					<h3>POSITION DESCRIPTION</h3>
					<p>We have compiled <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rn-fFbdSEHnjk1hUeHm2pzgAqNbR2bFhilflbf42IXM/edit">this</a> informational packet to demonstrate what makes Brown Science Prep (BSP) unique and to help you determine whether you would like to become a part of our BSP family of mentors.  This packet includes important information about our mission, our goals, and our structure.</p>
					<p>We are looking for Brown students who are equally passionate about science (a science concentration is NOT required) and community outreach.  Accordingly, we envision two distinctive yet interconnected roles.  As teachers, we seek to impart knowledge and problem-solving skills while promoting independent and creative thinking in our students.  As mentors, we seek to foster genuine relationships with our students, enabling them to feel comfortable enough to ask questions, participate actively, and just have a really fun time each Saturday.  We promise you that you will learn as much from our students as they will learn from you.</p> 
					<p>We hope that you will find the following information useful in deciding whether to apply as a mentor!</p>
